She is so genuine. I felt like she was seriously concerned about me and my well-being. She gave me her opinion and helped me interpret the reports. I started to tear up at the end of our call today because it felt like she was worried about me...almost like a parent. I felt like I had a good plan going forward and she asked me to keep her posted on my upcoming surgery. It meant everything to me to have someone care that much and to also give me direction on what to do next.&rdquo;</p>

Working with experts from all over the world is a terrific source of highly specific knowledge for the patient but also for every physician in charge of the patient.
<br>
PCM helps patient to have a deep and clear understanding of diagnosis and treatment options stated by the Experts, making them more confident with their disease and their choices. EMO and discussion with PCM help patients to trust medical care and to become active team player in their own health decisions. Spending time talking with a PCM is always a great benefit for the patient, resulting in a better comprehension of treatment options, medical key points, and probably leading to a better acceptation of condition and better tolerance to cure and recovery.&rdquo;</p>

Despite my concerns, the most frustrating part of all was never having anyone truly listen and work with me as a partner in trust. I felt comfortable dealing with Joshua from day one. And, never once did he leave me hanging or make me feel any detail I provided was irrelevant. That was probably the most significant for me overall. Furthermore, I would highly recommend this amazing group approach over a 2nd opinion. This method by far outweighs a second opinion. Just knowing a group of highly trained professionals mulled over my case with such attention to detail and came to the same or similar conclusion is reassuring. Thank you again Joshua for hearing my cries in the dark and for the amazing work you and your medical team did to assist me. Please thank each of them personally for me. May God richly bless you all for helping.&rdquo;</p>

        <p class="testimonial-card-text">&ldquo;Being a physician case manager provides a very unique opportunity to allow a patient unlimited access and support from you whether it be through advocacy, emotional support, Medical education or any other number of ways. Most of them have never been given the chance to speak to a doctor for as long as they feel is necessary to really be heard and it is very fulfilling to be able to offer that to them.
<br>
Another facet of advance medical that is so important is our ability to provide a sky high overview, in a comprehensive way, of a patient's entire care plan. We have the time and the resources to carefully cull together and review medical records from multiple doctors and specialists that they have seen, which unfortunately is near impossible for their pcp to do in this era of pcp shortages, managed care, and shortened face time with doctors. Often times our physicians have the first and only set of eyes to review a complete medical record since our skilled team is able to efficiently access records that they and their doctors offices have not been able to. In this way we can look at the big picture and so often that is what is missing. And the patients take such solace in knowing nothing has been left overlooked. That alone is one of the major pieces of positive feedback we receive and makes it a pleasure to do!&rdquo;</p>
