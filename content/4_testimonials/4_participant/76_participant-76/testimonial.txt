Text: Working with Aimee Nussbaum was great - she listened closely and provided great feedback. I got two additional opinions - which were wildly different from each other. While this might seem confusing, I was relieved that my issue was not a matter of consensus. It was empowering to know that there was room for disagreement and that there may be some gaps in many physicians' knowledge about the issue.
