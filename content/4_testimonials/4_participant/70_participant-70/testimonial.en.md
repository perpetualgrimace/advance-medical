Text: The physician who I worked with was accessible, courteous and communicative about next steps and expectations. The final report offered a helpful perspective on my uncertain situation which, while different from other medical opinions I received, was helpful to have. The comprehensiveness of the report was impressive. My deepest appreciation to my employer for making this available. Thanks to the folks at Advanced Medical for providing a quality service experience with a very sensitive benefits area.
