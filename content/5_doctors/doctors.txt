## Unlimited access to top doctors

### Physician relationships create better outcomes


Every Advance Medical case is directly managed by a Physician Case Manager, rather than a nurse or non-medical professional. We provide VIP-level concierge care and access to our world-wide base of experts to every patient. Our goal is always to help plan participants achieve the best outcome for any given condition.

Hear our physicians describe our case process in their own words (link: testimonials text: here).

## Help with decisions

### Physician relationships save time and money

Information on medical conditions, treatment plans, and navigating the healthcare system can all be confusing. Advance Medical helps provide clarity. Our Physician Case Managers serve as partners to patients in daily decision making, answering questions as they arise and providing timely, expert guidance on diagnoses and treatments.
