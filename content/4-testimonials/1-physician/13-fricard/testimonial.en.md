PCM helps patient to have a deep and clear understanding of diagnosis and treatment options stated by the Experts, making them more confident with their disease and their choices. EMO and discussion with PCM help patients to trust medical care and to become active team player in their own health decisions. Spending time talking with a PCM is always a great benefit for the patient, resulting in a better comprehension of treatment options, medical key points, and probably leading to a better acceptation of condition and better tolerance to cure and recovery.
