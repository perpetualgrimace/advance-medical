Text: Lisa Flemming was very helpful, courteous, and knowledgeable. I did feel that the report lacked some specifics which could have helped me to more comfortable with previous testing. But overall I am happy with the report and it has helped me to be somewhat more comfortable with my situation. Thank you Lisa!
