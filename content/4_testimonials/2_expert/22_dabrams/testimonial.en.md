Text: Patients may not always have access to appropriate experts when seeking a second opinion. Advance Medical allows for patients worldwide to obtain high-level consultation without leaving their homes. I always enjoy sharing my opinion and integrative oncology recommendations because I know I can offer the patient lifestyle and supplement information that they may not otherwise obtain. Giving cancer patients things that they themselves can do as part of their treatment regimen empowers them to feel more active and involved in their care.
