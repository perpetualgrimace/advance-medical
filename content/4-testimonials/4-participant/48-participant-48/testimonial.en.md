Text: I am a licensed marriage and family therapist. I thought all the employees were extremely professional and very caring. I was impressed with the quickness of the results. My situation is very complicated and one expert reassured me my treatment team was handling the situation very well. That was reassuring. The results did encourage my treatment team to try a different option, so that was helpful. I could not be more pleased with the service. It is amazing and excellent.
