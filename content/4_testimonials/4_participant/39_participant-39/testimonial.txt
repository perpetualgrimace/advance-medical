Text: Dr Reynolds was the absolute best doctor you could have assigned to me. I can't say enough about her expertise, kindness, and thoroughness. She is so genuine. I felt like she was seriously concerned about me and my well-being. She gave me her opinion and helped me interpret the reports. I started to tear up at the end of our call today because it felt like she was worried about me...almost like a parent. I felt like I had a good plan going forward and she asked me to keep her posted on my upcoming surgery. It meant everything to me to have someone care that much and to also give me direction on what to do next.
