Text: Advance Medical has given me the incredible opportunity to spend quality time with oncology patients. I cherish the ability to provide support, empower them with knowledge about their illness and what to expect, and to help them navigate what is often the most vulnerable and frightening experience in their health to date: a new diagnosis of cancer.
