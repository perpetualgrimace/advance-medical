Text: Given the information the doctors were given, their opinion was very important. I don't know what would have happened if I didn't find another doctor to go to. The first group did not give any information to work with. The doctor I am seeing now could only give information from one appointment that I had. I wanted to know mainly if the [medication] that was given to me was the correct medicine for me to take. The first group I was with I did not feel comfortable with and I don't think they even cared.
