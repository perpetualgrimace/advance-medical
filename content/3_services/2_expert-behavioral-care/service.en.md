Title: Expert Behavioral Care

----

Text:

40% of people suffering from chronic diseases also struggle with behavioral health problems. Too often, these go undiagnosed and untreated, leading to patients going off their medications and resulting in medical crises.

### How a flawed system magnifies the problem

When they do recognize a behavioral health problem, Primary Care Physicians have time only to treat symptoms, typically prescribing a drug to match the condition. This polypharmacy approach leads to unnecessary side effects, high drug costs, and limited benefits to patients.

### Access to psychiatrists trained to help

Expert Behavioral Care helps to identify those who need help and provides them access to trained psychiatrists with the time and freedom to treat the whole patient, and not only their symptoms.
