Text: I'm thankful for this entire process. It told me what my condition is, answered other questions I had, helped assist other doctors in my care / treatment, and told me that a form of treatment I'd already started on was in fact exactly what I need to get better. I will definitely recommend this program to anyone I feel like could benefit from it. From start to finish I've worked with a great Physician Case Mgr, Dr Seth Schonwald! He was very understanding, kind, and made sure that I understood exactly what was going on and what the report was saying. This entire process has been positive! Thank you to all that were involved!
