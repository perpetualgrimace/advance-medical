Title: Virtual Medical Homes

----

Text:

A Virtual Medical Home is a relationship with a sole practitioner whose focus is understanding the entirety of a person’s wellbeing and ensuring that, over the long term, they are efficiently achieving improved health. 



## Serving the underserved

Advance Medical identifies specific groups of patients in desperate need of advocacy and independent information. Our Virtual Medical Home concept pairs underserved patients with Specialist MDs who proactively assist with the management of the whole-health process.

Patents no longer need to suffer from barriers in communication, understanding, location, variations of care, limitations of local knowledge, cultural sensitivities, and indignities from well-meaning yet ignorant providers. The dedicated physicians staffing our Virtual Medical Homes have the time and ability to help patients navigate the healthcare system and plan for what is to come.
