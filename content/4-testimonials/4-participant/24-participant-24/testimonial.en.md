Text: I was extremely impressed with Case Manager...he was very polite and explained his role in Expert Medical Opinion. His telephone calls were timely and I felt comfortable communicating my situation with him. He impressed me with his thoroughness and made me feel he was really working on this. I cannot express to you how absolutely impressed I was when I received the [...] delivery of the report and the booklet format it arrived in.
