Text: When I used this service I didn't have my DX yet. I did not have the use of my hand for months and I felt it was getting worse. My appointment at [my treatment center] was at least a month away and I wasn't sure I could wait that long. You feel helpless going from MD to MD without any answers, this service gave me a sense of control and peace of mind that I could be pro-active while I was waiting to be seen by the specialists at [my treatment center]. I felt I was better informed for my appointment with the medical options I had received.
