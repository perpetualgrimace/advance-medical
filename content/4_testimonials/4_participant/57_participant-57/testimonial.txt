Text: I would like to thank Joshua Penn for his courteousness, professionalism and demeanor in dealing with the intricate details of my case. Despite my concerns, the most frustrating part of all was never having anyone truly listen and work with me as a partner in trust. I felt comfortable dealing with Joshua from day one. And, never once did he leave me hanging or make me feel any detail I provided was irrelevant. That was probably the most significant for me overall. Furthermore, I would highly recommend this amazing group approach over a 2nd opinion. This method by far outweighs a second opinion. Just knowing a group of highly trained professionals mulled over my case with such attention to detail and came to the same or similar conclusion is reassuring. Thank you again Joshua for hearing my cries in the dark and for the amazing work you and your medical team did to assist me. Please thank each of them personally for me. May God richly bless you all for helping.
