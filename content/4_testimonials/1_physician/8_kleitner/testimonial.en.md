Text: Being a physician case manager provides a very unique opportunity to allow a patient unlimited access and support from you whether it be through advocacy, emotional support, Medical education or any other number of ways. Most of them have never been given the chance to speak to a doctor for as long as they feel is necessary to really be heard and it is very fulfilling to be able to offer that to them.

Another facet of advance medical that is so important is our ability to provide a sky high overview, in a comprehensive way, of a patient's entire care plan. We have the time and the resources to carefully cull together and review medical records from multiple doctors and specialists that they have seen, which unfortunately is near impossible for their pcp to do in this era of pcp shortages, managed care, and shortened face time with doctors. Often times our physicians have the first and only set of eyes to review a complete medical record since our skilled team is able to efficiently access records that they and their doctors offices have not been able to. In this way we can look at the big picture and so often that is what is missing. And the patients take such solace in knowing nothing has been left overlooked. That alone is one of the major pieces of positive feedback we receive and makes it a pleasure to do!
