Text: I couldn't get a straight answers from the providers I'd seen and was referred to specialist after specialist. These opinions helped in that they raised consistent concerns and provided areas to consider for future treatment. My situation is not clear cut; yet their opinions reached similar conclusions. My case manager, Dr. Ortiz, was fantastic. He listened very carefully, did a great job in pulling the issues together, and he has been diligent in being in contact with me. I have been with [my company] for many years and this service became available to me just when I was losing hope that there was help out there. This input has been invaluable. Many thanks for the outstanding service.
