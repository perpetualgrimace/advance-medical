Text: Thank you again Advance medical. You have no idea how much I appreciate get the expert opinion of Dr. Levin. I so desperately wanted to know more about my spinal stenosis . What disks were involved, what other problems were noticeable, how long an operation would take and what risks and complications were involved. [My original treatment center] neglected to inform me about all the information that I longed for. They just sent me to get a spinal for the excruciating pain in my right leg and to physical therapy to strengthen my back.
