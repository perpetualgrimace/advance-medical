Text: I cannot say enough good about the program. My medical issue was one that I just didn't want to deal with. If it hadn't been for the various staff members reaching out to me, I would have just kept putting off making any decisions. My case manager was caring, easy to talk to, knowledgeable and very accessible. The opinion provided in the report really assisted in making my decision about the next steps to take in resolving my medical issue. Because the expert opinions supported what my doctor was telling me, it made me feel more confident in my doctor. This is an extremely valuable program that I hate to give up if my company even stops providing the program or when if I ever leave the company.
